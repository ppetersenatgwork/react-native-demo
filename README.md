# react-native-demo

A demo project based on this [tutorial application](https://www.raywenderlich.com/485-react-native-tutorial-building-ios-apps-with-javascript#c-rate). The code has been rewritten to use functional components with hooks and has been placed inside an [expo](https://expo.dev/) application.

The code has been rewritten to use [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) instead of the existing IOS specific navigation.
